# COVID Related Scrapers and datasets

Since April 2021, I have been writing couple of scrapers to pull information about the pandemic in India. A lot of the documentation is pending, and code wise they aren't the best scrapers honestly. 

For most of them, the data was being overwritten by government agencies so I first wanted to be able to pull and store those data sets, and not necessarily think about code optimisation. Almost all of them run on Github Actions in public repositories. 

Here is a list of all of them.
